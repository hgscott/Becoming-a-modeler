# Introduction

The construction and analysis of genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) is a well-established systems biology approach that can be used to predict metabolic and growth phenotypes.&#x20;

The ability of GEMs to produce mechanistic insight into microbial ecological processes makes them appealing tools that can open a range of exciting opportunities in microbiome research.&#x20;

Here, we aim to provide training and resources to prepare scientists (of all backgrounds) to apply genome-scale metabolic modeling in microbiome studies.

The `Educational Prerequisites` section aim to fill the knowledge gaps for researchers of different backgrounds.

The `Programming` and `Representing Biology with Math` sub-sections  may be more helpful for researchers with a biological background, where the `Biochemistry` and `Microbiology` sections may be helpful to computational researchers that do not have a biological background.

The following sections (`Ecology` - `Simulations` ) are resources that will be helpful for all researchers, regardless of background.
