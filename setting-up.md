# Setting Up

We have created a conda environmnt with (almost) all of the software you will need to go through these resources, the tools that are not included in this environment each have their own installation page when they are introduced.

To set up the conda environment:

1. Download the following file, titled `environment.yml`&#x20;



&#x20; 2\. Create a new environment from a YAML file using the `conda env create` sub-command as follows

```
conda env create --file environment.yml
```
