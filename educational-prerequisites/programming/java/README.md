# Java

While java is not the most common language for day-to-day analysis for most computational biologists, some notable tools, including COMETS are written in java.

There are many other reasons beyond editing COMETS to learn java:

1. It is one of top three most popular programming languages in the world.
2. Java is an extremely flexible language.
3. If you wirte a tool in java, it is very easy to distribute because all of the dependencies can be included in one jar-ball for a hastle-free download.&#x20;
4. Even though you can use object-oriented programming (OORP) in other languages, like python, the concepts behind OORP can be easier to learn using java.
