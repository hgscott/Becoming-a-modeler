# What is a JDK?

JDK is an acronym for Java Development Kit, it contains developer tools to help us code as well as a JRE (Java Runtime Environment) which contains a library and toolkits and our JVM (Java Virtual Machine) which translate byte code for us to machine code.

So, all you need to worry about is downloading a JDK, everything else will be included.

Now that we know what a JDK is, it is time to download one.
